+ fix autocomplition for raw:,ascii:,tcp:
+ do nothing by `history`if there is no interactive mode
+ skip `history` command from history
+ handle ctrl-c for cleaning current command. can interrupt usleep 100000
+ driver "tcp:" cannot be used for tx.
+ add command `source`
+ add possibillity put multiply options `-f` to read many script files
+ add autodetect filetype by extention *.raw -> raw:, .dat,txt -> ascii:

+ make ';' as command separator (now it's work only for -e scripts)
- timeout on SDM_STATE_WAIT_REPLY and SDM_STATE_RX
    see branch feature/wait-reply-timeout
- shell_getopts for commands (for ex. `history -t`, `ref -n num file`
  use history_arg_extract() from libreadline?
- in rl_hook_argv_getch() get pointer to config_shell from FILE *in
  with container_of().
  help not with signals handlers (?)
+ refactor shell_cb_completion() to move specific command completion
  description to sdmsh_command.c

+ fix bug after `source` no prompt
- fix bug if error in script called from `source`, quit from script
- fix usleep in interactive shell show prompt just after run
  ignore usleep in interactive show?

- try to refactor line input. call shell_handler directly from rl_cb_getline().
  this must fix problems with redraw prompt in call rl_callback_read_char()

- add to command `tx` possibillity get singals from several files
- add command `exit`
- add command `set`. and variable `log_level`
- add parameters to scripts like $1, $2..
- add support libsox for .wav files and resampling
- add support libsocat
- add driver exec:

+ in shell_input_add(.. SHELL_INPUT_TYPE_STDIO) check `if (!isatty(STDIN_FILENO))`
  and set interactive mode

- add to fw error reply on `usbl_rx` if there is no usbl support
- add to fw command 'change mode to/from SDM mode'
- add version of firmware request/reply

- FIXME: refactor to avoid -fpack-struct in CFLAGS
